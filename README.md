# Carbon-footprint-Calculator

This program prompts the user to enter their name, electricity usage, gas usage, transportation emissions, and waste emissions. It then calculates the user's total carbon footprint based on these inputs, using conversion factors for each category. The program outputs the user's name and total carbon footprint in metric tons of CO2 equivalent. Note that the conversion factors used in this program are just examples and may not be accurate for your specific location orÂ circumstances.
